This code is part of the submited paper:
A computational package to compute electrical resistivity tomography response for regular bodies 
immersed in a homogeneous half-space.
GEO-2022-0058.

=================================================================================================
This is an open source code for people who wants to understand the behavior and electric response 
of one or more bodies of simple geometry immersed in a half-space. Feel free to use it, modify it
and contribute.
=================================================================================================

Developed in Matlab R2016a. Open the sricpt VIMER_UI.m inside Matlab and run the code. The sript will
load all the necessary subroutines it needs. Just type the values of the bodies and characteristics
of the half-space in the corresponding windows. The user's guide, included in the zip file, explains
how to input the data. The results are displayed as a figure in a Matlab window.

The example folder contains the results of a single cube shaped body. If you want to check that the 
program runs properly, execute it for a single body and compare the output with the images provided.
