Thank you for downloading VIMER.

Version 1.5.1

This code is part of the submited paper:
Development of easy software to compute electrical resistivity tomography response, in the case of
regular bodies immersed in a homogeneous half-space; synthetic and study cases.

=================================================================================================
This is an open source code for people who wants to understand the behavior and electric response 
of one or more bodies of simple geometry immersed in a half-space. Feel free to use it, modify it
and contribute.
=================================================================================================

Developed in Matlab R2016a. Open the sricpt VIMER.m inside Matlab and run the code. The sript will
load all the necessary subroutines it needs. Just type the values of the bodies and characteristics
of the half-space in the corresponding windows. The user's guide, included in the zip file, explains
how to input the data. The results are displayed as a figure in a Matlab window.

The example folder contains the results of a single cube shaped body. If you want to check that the 
program runs properly, execute it for a single body and compare the output with the images provided.
